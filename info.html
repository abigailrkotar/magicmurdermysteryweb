                    <h2>About the App</h2>
                    <p>This app was started for a class project, where two friends teamed up to write and code this app. Magic Murder Myserty will be presented as a poster at a random conference that I cannot say because this is an anonymous submission. It is not currently complete but will be soon!</p>
